## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu) at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu) where I investigate fundamental problems in computer vision through the lens of self-supervised deep learning, under the supervision of [Erik Learned-Miller](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/index.html) at the [Vision lab](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu). I have also collaborated with [Mario Parente](http://rhogroup.org/index.php/people/mario-parente) from [RHOgroup](http://rhogroup.org/index.php), and [Ina Fiterau](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mfiterau/) from [InfoFusion lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home/) in the past on problems in applied computer vision and deep learning. And I have been a research intern twice at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and once at [Signify Research](https://www.signify.com/en-us), where I worked on a variety of topics from scene understanding to audio processing. In my free time, I love to cook gourmet dishes (especially those by Gordon Ramsay), and listen to classic rock music (Iâ€™m a big fan of Queen).

## Research Interests
